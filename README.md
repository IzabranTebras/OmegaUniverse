At present there are many mobile games due to the boom in mobile telephony and the facilities available to create your own game and hang it on the official store ("Google Play" or "App Store"). But in the realm of augmented reality there are few mobile games, this type of games are often more numerous in portables consoles and even on home consoles, especially due to the power of the hardware. For this project it was decided to bring augmented reality to mobile as a fighting game with Role Playing Game (RPG) features. To develop this project have been used Vuforia libraries, the program of modelling Blender, Unity to give logic and animation to characters and Gimp for the design of buttons and background images. As the development time is very short, we can only make a prototype, with which in the future can be advanced by adding features and new material (such as characters or new attacks).
